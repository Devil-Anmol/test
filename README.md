In a well-designed and secure system, changing or manipulating stored fingerprint information by a malicious app should not be possible. Fingerprint authentication on mobile devices typically relies on secure hardware components and follows specific security measures to prevent tampering and unauthorized access. 
Access to sensitive information, such as fingerprint data, is controlled through app permissions. Malicious apps generally do not have the necessary permissions to modify or access fingerprint data stored by other applications.
